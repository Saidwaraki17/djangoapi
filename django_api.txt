API -- Application Programming Interface
It is a interface that relates two servers,
interfaces or softwares to communicate
e.g our software is linked to youtube software

They have rules
e.g youtube has got many servers
1. we send data in json format to API and we get back 
data in json format
Hence, to transfer/receive data we need data in json 
2. We have servers on many internet they provide their 
APIs

Hence when user requests the data for info on a website
API in backend responds and sends a response on to 
the website

resources required for us

Company API
Employee API
    Here we share one to many relationship between 
Company and Employee


SIX STEPS TO HAVE A FULLWORKING API

1. Install Python, Django, and Django Rest Framework

2. set up django models - database

3. Set up serializers - i.e we convert data to json and 
it is converted into objects - Hence, here data is 
serialized and deserialized
i.e. 
when a request comes
-> if data is in json it is converted into objects
    and serialized
-> else if data is in object format it is directly
    serialized.

4. set up views - we accept request

5. set up urls - here url and views are mapped
    i.e they undergo mapping.

6. Final step - Test your API
    testing is through 2 softwares
    1. Browser
    2. Postman
